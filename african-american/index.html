		<p>Soul Train 1971, Where were was the African American community going?

		<p>If you were just to listen to the following list of songs and think of the African American community at that time, how many doctors, lawyers, upcoming college professors, teachers, school bus drivers and CEOs were there?</p>

		<ul>
			<li>SOS Band</li>
			<li>Gap Band</li>
			<li>Alexander O'Neal</li>
			<li>Dennis Edwards</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Theory, Sugar Hill Gang, Rappers Delight 1979 introduced, influenced unknowingly by an outside entity</p>

		<p>AC DC Back in black 1980 Album can maybe be seen a celebration album.</p>

		<h3>1990s</h3>
		<p>NBA + Sprite + Hip Hop, grouped African Americans grooming young youth to think about becoming professional athletes and hip hop artists instead of professionals</p>

		<p>Grown up, African American "Singers" not artists are extinct in America.</p>

		<p>If you were to take the next short list of Artists and compare to the previous, where are we heading? What does the future look like? We were a mix, now we might be a little more polarized.</p>


		<ul>
			<li>Dr Dre</li>
			<li>Master P</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Why FUBU over Karl Kani? We are back in the 1970s again.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/about_the_aba/profession_statistics/" target="_blank">https://www.americanbar.org/about_the_aba/profession_statistics/</a> only provides demographic statistics back to 2008, and the statistic is steady at roughly 5%.</p>

		<p>We love these artists, but something happened back in the early 80s that killed African American progression. Artists did what they could, but it created a cycle and it started back with Grandmaster flash. Do you understand?</p>

		<p>Rap, Hip Hop could be inspiring the youth to become hip hop artists and professional athletes not industry professionals. I would recommend focusing on artificial intelligence, networking, with an emphasis in mobile networking technologies. Mobile networks are going to be the final design, finance with a focus on international currencies and digital currencies like XRP and Bitcoin are all paths that all youths should focus on...</p>

		<p>Let me list the professions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Digital Currencies</li>
			<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
			<li>Mobile network engineers like LTE</li>
			<li>International Finance</li>
			<li>and of course School Teachers</li>
		</ul>


		<p>If you are interested in programming, choose Oracle, Microsoft is a good company but part of the problem, Oracle, Apple, Google are a much better companies.</p> 

		<p>This is off topic but on topic, important to know:</p>

		<p>Microsoft dumped a lot of money into India. Microsoft's CEO now is Indian from India, we had a nation of minorities and people impovershed but he overlooked them and added another minority into this country, then and made them a non minority at the same time. If you are not understanding, Microsoft was experiencing a big hit due to a couple factors, better products and the Open Source movement which has been stalled. They panicked and decided to teach poor people in India how to program on the .NET platform as well as pushed PHP another programming language. They could have done this in Mexico, South East Asia and Africa but decided not to. They chose India to basically bail them out because they were willing to work for nothing.</p>

		<p>Poo is the most important thing to Africa according to Mr. Gates...</p>
