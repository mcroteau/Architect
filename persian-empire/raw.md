How the Gods are at crucial conflict!

Hollywood is corrupted
Startups are being contaminated


Conflicts between the middle east and the rest of the World has been going on for centuries, it is only in the last 100 years attacks against the US have become more thoughtout, intelligent and covert.

My team believes the middle east to be fearful of Israel and the Jewish people or may be using them as bait.
My team believes they used Germany, Austria and others to create an anti-semetic belief system which caused both World Wars.
My team believes they are responsible for inciting conflicts between the United States, Germany, Russia, Japan, and now China. 

My team believes this to be a continuation of the Persian Empire and even though there are borders much of the Middle East shares similar goals.


List of countries that can be grouped together, some countries may be missing in this write up. We just wanted to get ideas out, and out fast. Time is ticking.

My group believes that each group represents an Architect, an overseer and Earth is like the game of Risk. "Let's see if we can spread our culture and become the Worlds super power". Its no longer in your face, it now is suttle. So suttle you wouldn't have ever guessed at first glance. Here is an example : 

Hello in Turkish, and in Arabic


Merhaba 
Marhabaan


What does this represent? At one point Turkey hosted the Greek city of Troy where Greek was the spoken language.


Preserve our cultures
Dont allow the Persian Empire to continue to spread!

As United States group, allow freedom of religion!
Exclude people from... India as they may be acting as an arm


How the Persians are using sex, political pollution, language pollution and entertainment pollution to ruin the United States.

Let start with sex :

Language pollution : 

I believe the Saudis allied with the Germans have been using people from India. 

Mercari
Carvana
Trivago
MarketingSherpa

These words end in vowels

Our Brand Identities are becoming sloppy, not like the days of Nike, Rebok and Addidas.

Another form of language pollution:

The were absorbed by the Persian Empire back in the early days and now a days Turkish is a variant of Greek and Arabic.

Hello pronounced in Arabic

Marhabaan

Hello in Turkish

Marhaba

Lets look at Greek altogether. The modernized version of Greek has elements that resemble Arabic markings.


Lets look at Hollywood, (because of India an arm of the Persian Empire some by mistake and Germany an ally by I hope mistake after reading this.)




Some of you may be asking how can I group Britain, Germany, Russia, Spain, Italy together? Dialects of language. Our creator is responsible I believe for :

People first.


Its a reality, the Persian empire continues and awareness is all that is suggested


Fox News is backed by a Middle Easter entity

Last Action Hero



If you are Caucasian, any of the countries listed above we want and need Africa on our side. If you are Africa, it should have now dawned on you that there are people fighting to gain your support, primarily the Irish, British, and especially the French.




There are people that have information regarding the future


How important is African

Currently there are : 

12 Arabic Speaking nations in Africa
20 English Speaking nations in Africa
26 French Speaking nations in Africa

I believe the World can be split into 4 major empires:

Greek
Persian
Asian
Afrika
