			<p>We were all created, <strong>all created independently,</strong> each race independently, in order to create a unique and different World, a World that could not be created with one race... each one of us Original in Design.</p>


			<img src="images/africa-cropped.png" id="africa"/>



			<h2>Are we really Original Designs?</h2>


			<p>There are distinct differences between all the cultures here on Earth. Observe a few cultures some which are neighboring and ask how did they come to be? Was each created independently, or one created with adaption and evolution.</p>

			<p>The answer independently. Let's take a look...<br/>
				Remember compare...

			<p>Brazil</p>

			<img src="images/brazil_people.jpg" style="width:100%;"/>
			

			
			<p><span class="emphasis">We are all different</span> It is plain as day. There is no environmental component, weather pattern or diet that shaped us individual people over time. Evolution does not exist.</p>

			
			<p>In details, observing images above, you can start to think about the cultures, architecture, food and lives of the people. Each are different. Start to combine the cultures and people and you have something unique, something different, something new that the our Grand Architect or God could not create with one race.</p>

			<p>Do you understand? Let me explain : </p>


			<p>There is only so much preference data that can be stored within a human being. If one race or culture occupied the planet, all blocks of civilizations would look the same. However, mix in some variety, more than one race and you have the possibility of cultures working together to create a unique civilization, a unique World. Like ingredients to an ultimate recipe, we, each group or race of people are designed to be part of a master design... <strong>a design so grand so unique no one person can grasp.</strong></p>


			<p class="minor">...This includes architecture, music, culinary arts, spirits, dance and movement, how we interact, anything and everything, we could create a unique and different World, it will happen so long as every human being is allowed to live freely. Change will happen organically.</p>


			<p>Like this song for instance, with a touch of early 80's R&B, it is strongly influenced by the electronic genre, Kavinsky, Georgio Moroder, Litany and others, <strong>it is a beautiful blend</strong>, something unique that could not have been created while being influenced by one race or culture.</p>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p id="challenge" style="margin-top:172px;">So you want to challenge the existence of God and the idea of creationism...</p>

			<h1 style="line-height:1.4em; font-size:79px !important">The Existence of God...</h1>

			<p>It can be proven within the definitive design in nature, and mathematics within the design. Take a look at the following image. Ask how did it come to be?</p>


			<img src="images/aloe_plant_math.jpg" style="width:100%"/>


			<p>Do you see the uniformity and math within the design? You should, it's there. There is no challenging it. If Math is visible within the design, it means that it was <strong>created.</strong> The point of this, we were all created, all life on Earth created, no evolution involved in our existence... yet.</p>

			
			<p class="emphasis bold">Proof that we were created. Let's do an exercise...</p>
			
			<p>I want you to take a look at your hand. There is an architect at play. Look at your hand from the side, do so while starting to wiggle your fingers and move your hand back and forth. Do this in front of a plant.</p>  


			<img src="images/hand.png" style="width:37%"/>


			<p>It's important that you perform this exercise next to or in front of a plant. Spend at least a 15 seconds performing this exercise,  ask the question while performing this, "Does the hand belong? Is the human hand foreign?"</p> 


			<img src="images/leaf-cropped.jpg" style="width:100%"/>

			
			<p>The hand is foreign, the human existence is foreign, we all together everything human is foreign. <span class="emphasis">We did not grow or originate from Earth. We were created by God, by an Architect.</span> To support this case, let's consider the single celled organism theory, that we all originated including animal life from a single celled organism, it is a harsh reality that the the amount of data that would need to reside within the starting single celled organism would be very large. It cannot be stressed enough that life on Earth would be very very strange. Evolution does not exist, we did not originate from a single celled organism. We were created by an Architect.</p>
			

			<p class="minor">There is only so much preference data that can stored within DNA...</p>

			<!--
			<p><span class="emphasis">By now</span> depending on your background, the "Single Celled" theory should be dismissed. <span class="emphasis">There is in fact a God, a grand Architect at work.</span></p>
			-->

			<p class="emphasis bold" style="font-size:72px;">The Solar System</p>

			<img src="images/solar_system.jpg" style="width:100%;margin-bottom:21px;"/>


			<p>The solar system consists of 8 planets that orbit the Sun. These planets orbit in a horizontal fashion. While orbiting these planets tilt and rotate... its systematic, uniform in design. An Architect is at play, God.</p>

			
			<p class="emphasis bold">Again, why different cultures, what is our purpose...</p>
			
			<p>... Again, there are differences in preferences between different races or organizations of people. If two different races were to bare a child, the preferences for that child would be unique... a blend. He or she would have preferences from both cultures and may in turn prefer something new... again a blend. Blends can be something as simple as food or drink, something like Cherry Sprite, Ginger Ale with Lemonade or Chicken &amp; Waffles, all can be seen as blends.</p>

			<p><span class="emphasis bold">You don't have to believe in intercultural relationships,</span> it does however need to be allowed to happen naturally, but not forced.</h2>
			

			<p class="minor">It has an opportunity of happening...</p>



			<img src="images/sinhala.png" style="margin-top:300px;"/>

			<p>This is "Thank you!" in Sinhala, language of Sri Lanka. It is probably the most interesting language...
