### Evolution doesnt exist 

The answer, no...  each race is originally designed, each design original with its own set of preferences 
with the ultimate goal of creating a different World, a World that could not be created with one race. 
God exists, he wants cohabitation, it is the ultimate test, so QUIT INTERFERING if you are.
