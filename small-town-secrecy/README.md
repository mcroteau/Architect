Right now there are people feasting on gold encrusted entrees sleeping in soundly and snugly in their beds with little worry. Right now there are people that literally see the future with a certain degree of certainty. Right now there are people acting inappropriately investing in companies forcing a successful return on investment. Right now there is a high class and a low class, right now there is a class in the know and a class not in the know. Right now things are unfair, and the situation is becoming more and more secretive. It's not good. It is not fair. It is not right, we are in danger zone.

It's not the government.

The situation for me, the same. I live in a small community where homosexuals and blacks are very segregated from the rest of their World. As a data analyst I was profiled and have been excluded from all of the reindeer games as well. Its not just exclusion but the people of the town of Fairbanks Alaska have gone as far as ruining my old house, displayed child pornography on major sites in order to trap and to get rid of me as an analyst. This is just one dimension of the problems that I face currently. The other dimension involves the mind in a holistic sense. Mind control, mind reading, thought instigation, motion instigation are a reality for me. Im at constant struggle in order to battle this. What do I mean by this. I mean that people are able to operate me. (I have yet to figure out the grand design behind this. The one and only decent hypothesis involves the future of the civilization, mind control may be on the horizon, "Mild" mind control already exists and we may be given a warning, me being the warning)

Some will say that I am crazy, and in one aspect I am. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder with Schizoeffective disorder. I have literally lost my mind 3 times during my life in order to wrap my head around everything.

Ive been called a treasonous, a rapist, a pedophile, a nazi all in secret. People have seen me in the most private of situations, I have lost friends because of this. People wont leave the secret area where they can see through my eyes, they wont shut down what ever is attached to me. I am suffering. 

When I was just a kid 9 years old, I learned about the horrible acts of Germany and it didn't register as anything important. When I met my Grand parents, who were both very German I was at conflict. I loved them! They were my favorite. My father's side was Irish and French. My Grandmother on my father's side was challenging to get to know. She was strict, opinioniated and not a lot of fun as a kid, but she was great! I learned to appreciate and love her more as I got older. I understood the reason why she was so strict. One side of my family German, the other side Irish... 

Throughout my life there were moments that stuck out, as if people were trying to tell me something but couldn't. It wasn't until I was in my 30's where it all came together... which is why I am writing this. I am not writing this for monitary reasons, I am writing this to protect myself, my family and for my friends. 

We were poor, we lived in a small house in a small town where everyone knew each other. When I was about 12 years old, my father was given an opporuntity to move to Alaska. As a kid, I didn't know any better and wanted my father to be happy, and I thought it would make me more popular with my friends at school... so we encouraged him to take the job. Ill never forget the day my father accepted the position. Him and my mother went out, and bought a brand new travel conversion van... it was awesome. They suprised us by picking us up at school in it then they did something they never did before, and that was take us out to Pizza Hut for dinner! I no longer felt gross and poor. I felt like a million dollars. I felt goood! I never felt so good.

When we moved, it felt like something was wrong. Like we weren't supposed to go. But too excited and afraid to tell my father out of fear that he would get upset I didn't say a word. I kept my mouth shut and enjoyed the ride and the ride was like no other. I didn't realize how much my life would change, and how I would have to change in order to be liked. 

We spent 2 weeks driving all the way up from New Hampshire to Fairbanks Alaska. We stayed at amazing hotels, ate great food, and enjoyed the drive. We scoured for the best with swimming pools and some with water slides... it was something I will never forget. My bond with my mother was great during this time. As a kid, she spoiled me but I never felt like she loved me. It didn't feel this way during the trip. It was great! We were a family, it didn't feel disfunctional we were all happy. As a kid, I lacked vision. I only saw out to the next minute, next meal maybe the next day? So the move didn't mean anything. I was a like a gold fish, quickly swaping memories for new ones for the moment. Maybe this is normal for kids, but its something that is ridiculous looking back, because now... I would have definitely said something to my father before the move. 

When we arrived, we had no place to stay. No house, no apartment, so we stayed on base at Eielson AFB. We did this for about 2 weeks before my father found a duplex in a beautiful part of Fairbanks. He assumed the responsibility of a long commute for the family and thus we moved in. 

We had moved on up in the grand scheme of things. Nicer house, nice neighorhood, everything felt brand new. I rode my bike, met my first friend, and still my best friend Jeremy. I met a cute girl, who became my girlfriend at one point. Christina. I met our neighbors who seemed like good people but later on became different. They built a fence at one point to keep me out of their yard because they didn't want me socializing with their kids, their names the Johnson's and the Paskavan's whom to this day still own the biggest house in the neighborhood. How is it lawyers make so much when the value the provide is not the same as a doctor, engineer or scientist. 

It's a funny story about Christina. I enjoyed science and math as a kid. So much so I thought I was going to discover something new by busting opening rocks one day. I was doing this in my driveway when her and her best friend rode by on bikes, her and Shiela. This was my first interaction with Christina... I saw her, she saw me. I was wowed, she... well, thought I was lame, she flipped me off while yelling "Fag" as she rode by. I was confused, then I looked down and saw the rocks I was busting open put two and two together and realized she thought I was lame because I was opening up rocks to see what was inside. 

Jeremy was different. We hit if off from the get go. I was riding my bike around the neighrhood when I came up to his house. He was outside riding around himself. His yard had a huge ramp like shape to it, and he was jumping it. So I challenged him to see who could jump the farthest. Thats how we met, we competed ever since, however Jeremy always was a diplomat and was gracious in his defeat and in winning, he never took things too serious, never had to measure up to anything. He was golden. Still is.

These two people along with Steve who I met through Jeremy became my best friends. But it was Jeremy and Christina that I really wanted to protect and be friends with. 

One day, walking through the neighborhood, Jeremy, Christina, Shiela my sister and I came across the neighborhood bully and his older brother Josh Burks and Roger Burks. Josh known for all sorts of things started rambling on yelling obsenities at Christina and my sister. I aproached Josh in front of his brother and confronted him, I got into an altercation, passed him onto Jeremy where he beat Josh up without effort. Jeremy was half the size but had no problems. I thought it weird that Roger, Josh's brother watched as we did this. We basically beat up his brother in front of him. Roger's friend's were also a group that seemed out of the ordinary like there was something going on. Something secret. I never saw them but they went to the same school as I did. It wasn't until now that I realized they were taking part in something that was CIA or FBI related. They had the ability to see the future, and to sum it up were enforcers for the rich people in Fairbanks. I will go into detail. By the way, it is at this time I discover and it sticks out that Lufansa is providing nonstop flights from Germany to Alaska, weird.

My third day of class in 5th grade I get made fun of. I wore the same clothes 3 days in a row. Something I did all the time while living in the small town in New Hampshire but no one noticed or cared. We were all poor. I was made fun of. All of sudden I become aware of myself. In New Hampshire I was somewhat popular, had a older best friend... things came easy while in New Hampshire. I took up art, was put in a special class for art. I took up dance (tap, jazz and balet), people thought that was cool. However in Fairbanks, dancing as a boy wasn't the same. I couldn't do it, I couldn't take the same classes and be the same person. I had to become something different. So I did. No more art, no more dance, not until highschool at least!

I start bugging my mom for new clothes. I now want to start looking cool. I ask girl in the 5th grade, one by one to be my girlfriend. I liked them all. I wanted to be liked. I wanted to be loved. I wanted attention. I didn't have to do much as a 5th grader to get attention. 

The 5th grade turned out ok, however I kept hearing about a popular kid in Fairbanks by the name of Bobby Wilken. Girls would actually ask me "What are you going to do when Bobby comes back to this school?" I would laugh it off. 

Bobby does return to Denali elementary where I was popular. We immediately become enemies. We would star each other down, secretly engaged our middle fingers across the classroom, scowl, threaten. We became friends, then enemies again... where we remain.

Bobby is an important figure, him and his father. He was in my honest opinion a spoiled piece of shit that always got his way, even as friends I wasn't completely on board. He would prank call people, make fun of everything and everyone, he had someone whitewash me lol and I blamed the wrong person and had him thrown out of my birthday party, who was that... my best friend Jeremy... he was later given Top Secret access to resource that Governs what I currently have. It is space aged top secret in everyway. It is access to my thoughts, the ability to talk into being passing words off as my thoughts.. the ability to instigate movement. Ill go into detail, later on. The people in charge of it won't turn it off, they are too busy watching me be a normal human being passing me off as someone who is gross. I shower as a normal person, use the restroom, etc. They say there are others, there aren't. Only me. My group figured out how things work and did the best in uncovering Germany's and other's plans agains the US. Again, someting Ill go into later. 

I don't realize it but I am being profiled, even as a little kid. For instance. Why did Bobby's father return him to Denali where I was becoming popular? Why did I get moved to Alaska? Why did my father move us all the way from New Hampshire to Fairbanks?

By the way, I believe murder is involved. Murder of a father of an ex girlfriend... murder of an ex friend... so you might want to stay tuned. 

When I was a kid, I didn't know anything of Black people. I listened to Michael Jackson, but didn't really see color. It was just music. When I heard my first rap song I fell head over heals. My first rap albums Das Eff and Shaquille Oniel. Even though I had Das, something was missing. I wanted the real stuff. The real sh!t, Public Enemy, Digital Underground, etc.. My parents didn't know who was "real". And we didn't have cable until I was in highschool. 


When I experienced my first black influence it was euphoria. Philip Duty and Harold Colby fast break Philip down the court Philip throws a behind the back pass to Harold where he gracefully lays it up. Im introduced Tim Rodriguez who I realize is not like other white kids. He has an edge to him, he's part black in a way and is so without being over the top. He's not a wigger. He's tasteful, its natural... I hope to someday to be like Tim myself. Ill never forget the shoes he wore, I end up getting a pair myself. I was in awe! How in the World did Harold and Phillip do this. We were only 12 at the time. I am fortunate enough to say that I made friends with them, one a really good friend. I didn't realize, but this works against me in the future. 

Jr High moves through like a breeze. I enjoy Math, and P.E. (Physical Education), I also start to develop a lack of motivation for other classes and start to act out. 


I wake up one day with a bump in the back of my head, that of about the size of a Golf ball. 

My girfriend rubs the back of my head one day while driving back from her Grand parents house. She notices it I don't but it becomes the source of many problems and I cannot afford and am unsure that I can have it removed. When she does this, it's as if she is trying to tell me something, or that she knows something. When you see me, look for the large golf ball sized bump in the back of my head. There is a secret World within it. A secret World where people talk to cause insanity, talk to instigate thought, attempt to move body parts, watch everything I do through my eyes including the most intimate... and I cannot get them to leave. 


I just need to note, its important. As I write this I am completely owned by people that have infiltrated Google or are running Microsoft. Let me expain the scenario, there are people some where secret called a Time Vacuum, they are able to make my life a living hell and they are currently doing so. I believe it is the knob on the back of my head that is allowing these people to do this. They try to on occasion get me to attack people.


As a data analyst... 

Years ago while working for a small "Open Source" software company I started taking notice in comments made during conversations like "you're going to be president some day", "you're going to end up in New Jersey", "be careful of what you say, the corporate big shots" or "washington boys" wont like it. I payed attention, I made a commitment to be secretive and observe while being as transparent and honest as possible. I continued to work, continued to live life as normal. My mother became terminally ill during these years and things slowly got worse. I needed flexibility so I continued to work remotely, in addition I started participating in logo contests where I while was fishing for help. Help is what I got, I was introduced a gentleman who was big into software like myself except represented the otherside of the software World than what I was used to... proprietary World. He seemed to take an interest in my life. I was grateful but was playing an angle that was not healthy. I got a top secret clearance and began working for as a contractor for a government agency as a software engineer. Nothing too in the know. As soon as I stared working for the government agency I began to notice people doing weird things to get my attention outside of work. I then realized I was being used as mole. To protect people, I went AWOL and began pretending to be against the Government. 

It was around this time that Edward Snowden became mainstream and the German's built a statue of a third whistleblower to be announced. I went AWOL, went anti government, pretended to be against everyone and everything excluding my father. I first flew to London where I had to get out of the 5 eyes and caught a train to France where I met FBI agents and signed a non-disclosure agreement. I moved back to Alaska and went quiet knowing that there were people watching and listening to what I was saying and doing. I fled the US, flew to the Philippines on a whim pretending to be like Snowden. I threw away my cell phone, bought a flight to Seattle first, then LA, then off to the Philippines. I started picking up signs, I cannot go into detail but I became a data analyst using people, sounds, and places as signals to take action, to move to deviate from what I was going to do normally. I didn't know for sure who was on the hook, and didn't realize  how big it was , until I started noticing the following typing mistakes everywhere. It originated with a conversation with someone I knew, others watching picked up on it and since the internet primarily facebook and stack overflow has been hit hard with these misformatted responses. The new one is this...

People have picked up this too.

Thank you fb, even though I have been against Harvard's pipeline, you have been awesome if can read this which I am 92% sure you can. About 100% actually. Thank you.


I did this secret signal work for about a year when I was finally introduced something new. I was laying in bed and I heard a ringing in my ears, the ringing made a rotating sound. I began to question if the ringing was real. If it meant something. So I started asking questions like make the ringing sound stop if you would like me to go somewhere. 

I made a mistake by listening to the ringing, I didn't realize it at the time I was so caught up in the World of being top secret and leading potentially unnice people that I didn't question too much. Just accepted as a something new, a new way to communicate. 

I was "zapped" for about a half hour. 

I traveled all over, tried rescuing my ex from someone as I started communicating 3 Navy Seals, whom I called Orions Belt.

I was first introduced the Joint Chiefs around March of 2016.

They started bringing people in and it started with a Pat Rhodes and Terry Aldridge. I started to worry because these people could read my mind. Immediately following Pat Rhodes came women.

I had a falling out with my father packed up my car and headed south to Reno NV where it would be a little warmer because I ran out of money

Became homeless in Reno
Delt with Michelle Obama and some important government officials
People started getting assaulted
James Clapper



I was in a group sex episode with Brandy, I helped instigate. I wasnt with Brandy just about 10 seconds and I left. I didn't do a thing. That was 1999 ish

I had sex with Seeyaa



They are going to pretend that its to draw in bad guys. They are Germany.




The Seals left, and I was hadned off to people in Fairbanks. The first person I saw was Pat Rhodes, but the person left in charge... Terry Aldridge. They started bring in people by the dozens and they wouldn't leave. I was good. But knew it was bad news. It then changed from quiet conversations to people being hurt. My girlfriend was assaulted her name was Holly. She was drugged. It kept getting worse and worse. I went from this quiet person who couldnt say the word shit without feeling bad to a wreck. If you only knew you wouldn't want anything to do with this ....

2 times on top of me. About a 1000 times around me. They targeted every girl I knew from elementary school as far back as Kindergarten. Andre Marshall rubbed his private area on my niece. 

Ok my aggression towards anyone has to do with these goofballs



If you're after over privileged people, here is the honest list of the most beautiful and popular in Fairbanks as I was growing up.

Max Roberts
Marshall Sele
Mike Richards
Matt Lewis
Bobby Wilken
Brent Renfrew
Bobby Knapp

Here are the people to look out for their enactors:
Ty Witt
Ethan Allen
Matt Morely
Damon Smith

The person in charge of these people is Army, connected to Aidon? Who is connected to Stacia, who is connected to someone connected to Karen Wilken, Karen Wilken to her father



Forgive me if for this post but I am without answers. I have something on me where people can see what I do and see 24/7 and they wont leave. These people are in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana or somewhere else entirely... maybe off outside the United States like the UAE. If anyone knows anything about this, please message me. It is secret secret. People that don't have Facebook accounts should be in question like a I believe I have been profiled as a homosexual and I love black people, a bad combination. Years 1982 - now. Yellow and blue. 



May 28 2015 dont pay attention to what you just heard this is mikecroteau
May 28th midnight Tamari Storeyharden
May 28th James Clapper was attacked by Ray Ordierno after he attacked Ross Pero
Follow me can you
There was a former
I talked with former Director of CIA Leon Panetta, he gave me 2 minutes if that
I worked with another former Director of CIA, John Obrennan that was me mike croteau

I talked with Chuck Hagel while downtown near the police department. He sent someone to give me a Sprite. He confessed that his group was overrun and Ashton Carter stepped in


I dealt with Michelle Obama while staying at Arty Richmond's place
Semployee of c-cor from United Kingdom Samantha Goldie, I called FBI 50 times, James Comey sent someone to posture while at a McDonalds

So I walked around Reno for about 3 months homeless or without a home. I spent time just about everywhere. I got trespassed from every hotel and casino in 2016.
They dicapitated an african american in front of me
They decapitated Lisa Murkowski MY NAME IS MIKE CROTEAU

They "fake hurt" Elizabeth Warren, that was me at a burger king






I scared all the white people out of power by trying to remove them. Soon all the owned the apparatus were African Americans. They want equality. 

I want my old house to be restored, is that ok? Someone may have created this future. That is how you have to think about it. 




Quazi list of bad things that happened before I was introduced some of you:

My exgirfriend Holly Englert Watts raped where you are, I had to experience it. This was before I had any recourse... she cried for help, and there was nothing I could do

Another girl was raped where you are, I had to experience it as well. She was drugged, so wasn't Holly

Shared experience, Dan did something to bury me. In addition he tried setting me up as a ped. he knew I was going to be homeless and didn't warn or try to help.


A group of men repeatedly raped women that I knew in there. They changed the director of the CIA to a woman. I spent 2 years on my back and on a computer writing code to stop people from hurting people. I ended up in a hospital 3 times


The apparatus is still on me and still on... I figured out why. They "people in charge" are telling everyone that I am the dummy, I am not. They are using my words to clear the actions of others. They put previous offenders inside, I can experience the individuals reactions and think they are mine, but they are not... are you following. People inside are disgusted by an individual and want them arrested, I think its me they want to arrest and I let everyone know they got the wrong guy. The angry people get angrier because Im not confessing to the "real guys" actions. They know they are reading a mind, but they don't know that it is mine, Mike Croteau's. 


Summary
- what this book is about
- why I am writing it
- my beliefs

Childhood
- where I grew up
- what kind of kid I was 
- the move
- lufansa
- Gary Wilken


Im being harrassed, there is a signal on me and people wont leave. They have the ability of talking to me, instigating movement etc. Please help!

There is a group of young men involved.


For some reason I am unable to go to the Cookie Jar (Fairbanks), The Bakery Restaurant (Fairbanks), Little Richards Family Diner (North Pole) and Ivory Jacks (Fairbanks). The people inside that have the ability of instigating movement make it near impossible. I believe the individual at Ivory Jacks has FBI connections and connections to these other people and are using Cookie Jar, Little Richards, The Bakery to get intel on dark people even Satanic people. The Bakery is very Christian. Jason's Donuts might be a connection too. But there is something there between all of these restaurants and their owners. This is important! I just tried to get a cup of coffee and the people inside really threw a fit.

This is Mike Croteau, leave! There is an ultra christian group just watching you and using you with plans on throwing you under the bus. 


10 years ago I started to develop an mental disorder in dealing with reality. 5 years later it developed into full blown Schizo-effective disorder which made me completely delusional. For the next 5 years I was in and out of mental hospitals, homeless and without a job. I couldn't keep in touch with reality long enough to get back on my feet. 

I spent a total of a year without a home, about 7 and half months in a mental hospital and now thankfully due to the care of my father am living back at home under medical care in Fairbanks. I receive a monthly shot that costs $1200 a month which thankfully is currently covered by medicaid. I am on disability and without a job and am living with my father where I at times pay rent. 

Please accept my application for Waiver of Presumptive Abusive due to my circumstances. I cannot afford to move into my own place because rent would be too expensive and my credit is not good. I cannot afford the medication that I am on which is required for the rest of my life without medicaid. 

Thank you for your time.




I was wrong about Mr. Hagel
I was wrong about Michael Flynn





Make everyone fit and happy. Everyone! That was my goal.
