Right now there are people eating gold encrusted food sleeping in soundly in their beds without worry. Right now there are people that see the future with a certain degree of certainty. Right now there are people acting as inappropriately investing in companies forcing a successful return on investment. Right now there is a high class and a low class, right now there is a class in the know and a class reaching hoping to get a crumb. Right now things are unfair, and it's becoming more and more secretive. It's not good. It is not fair. 

When I was just a kid 9 years old, I learned about the horrible acts of Germany and it didn't register as anything important. When I met my Grand parents, who were both very German I was at conflict. I loved them! They were my favorite. My father's side was Irish and French. My Grandmother on my father's side was challenging to get to know. She was strict, opinioniated and not a lot of fun as a kid, but she was great! I learned to appreciate and love her more as I got older. I understood the reason why she was so strict. One side of my family German, the other side Irish... 

Throughout my life there were moments that stuck out, as if people were trying to tell me something but couldn't. It wasn't until I was in my 30's where it all came together... which is why I am writing this. I am not writing this for monitary reasons, I am writing this to protect myself, my family and for my friends. 

We were poor, we lived in a small house in a small town where everyone knew each other. When I was about 12 years old, my father was given an opporuntity to move to Alaska. As a kid, I didn't know any better and wanted my father to be happy, and I thought it would make me more popular with my friends at school... so we encouraged him to take the job. Ill never forget the day my father accepted the position. Him and my mother went out, and bought a brand new travel conversion van... it was awesome. They suprised us by picking us up at school in it then they did something they never did before, and that was take us out to Pizza Hut for dinner! I no longer felt gross and poor. I felt like a million dollars. I felt goood! I never felt so good.

When we moved, it felt like something was wrong. Like we weren't supposed to go. But too excited and afraid to tell my father out of fear that he would get upset I didn't say a word. I kept my mouth shut and enjoyed the ride and the ride was like no other. I didn't realize how much my life would change, and how I would have to change in order to be liked. 

We spent 2 weeks driving all the way up from New Hampshire to Fairbanks Alaska. We stayed at amazing hotels, ate great food, and enjoyed the drive. We scoured for the best with swimming pools and some with water slides... it was something I will never forget. My bond with my mother was great during this time. As a kid, she spoiled me but I never felt like she loved me. It didn't feel this way during the trip. It was great! We were a family, it didn't feel disfunctional we were all happy. As a kid, I lacked vision. I only saw out to the next minute, next meal maybe the next day? So the move didn't mean anything. I was a like a gold fish, quickly swaping memories for new ones for the moment. Maybe this is normal for kids, but its something that is ridiculous looking back, because now... I would have definitely said something to my father before the move. 

When we arrived, we had no place to stay. No house, no apartment, so we stayed on base at Eielson AFB. We did this for about 2 weeks before my father found a duplex in a beautiful part of Fairbanks. He assumed the responsibility of a long commute for the family and thus we moved in. 

We had moved on up in the grand scheme of things. Nicer house, nice neighorhood, everything felt brand new. I rode my bike, met my first friend, and still my best friend Jeremy. I met a cute girl, who became my girlfriend at one point. Christina. I met our neighbors who seemed like good people but later on became different. They built a fence at one point to keep me out of their yard because they didn't want me socializing with their kids, their names the Johnson's and the Paskavan's whom to this day still own the biggest house in the neighborhood. How is it lawyers make so much when the value the provide is not the same as a doctor, engineer or scientist. 

It's a funny story about Christina. I enjoyed science and math as a kid. So much so I thought I was going to discover something new by busting opening rocks one day. I was doing this in my driveway when her and her best friend rode by on bikes, her and Shiela. This was my first interaction with Christina... I saw her, she saw me. I was wowed, she... well, thought I was lame, she flipped me off while yelling "Fag" as she rode by. I was confused, then I looked down and saw the rocks I was busting open put two and two together and realized she thought I was lame because I was opening up rocks to see what was inside. 

Jeremy was different. We hit if off from the get go. I was riding my bike around the neighrhood when I came up to his house. He was outside riding around himself. His yard had a huge ramp like shape to it, and he was jumping it. So I challenged him to see who could jump the farthest. Thats how we met, we competed ever since, however Jeremy always was a diplomat and was gracious in his defeat and in winning, he never took things too serious, never had to measure up to anything. He was golden. Still is.

These two people along with Steve who I met through Jeremy became my best friends. But it was Jeremy and Christina that I really wanted to protect and be friends with. 

One day, walking through the neighborhood, Jeremy, Christina, Shiela my sister and I came across the neighborhood bully and his older brother Josh Burks and Roger Burks. Josh known for all sorts of things started rambling on yelling obsenities at Christina and my sister. I aproached Josh in front of his brother and confronted him, I got into an altercation, passed him onto Jeremy where he beat Josh up without effort. Jeremy was half the size but had no problems. I thought it weird that Roger, Josh's brother watched as we did this. We basically beat up his brother in front of him. Roger's friend's were also a group that seemed out of the ordinary like there was something going on. Something secret. I never saw them but they went to the same school as I did. It wasn't until now that I realized they were taking part in something that was CIA or FBI related. They had the ability to see the future, and to sum it up were enforcers for the rich people in Fairbanks. I will go into detail. By the way, it is at this time I discover and it sticks out that Lufansa is providing nonstop flights from Germany to Alaska, weird.

My third day of class in 5th grade I get made fun of. I wore the same clothes 3 days in a row. Something I did all the time while living in the small town in New Hampshire but no one noticed or cared. We were all poor. I was made fun of. All of sudden I become aware of myself. In New Hampshire I was somewhat popular, had a older best friend... things came easy while in New Hampshire. I took up art, was put in a special class for art. I took up dance (tap, jazz and balet), people thought that was cool. However in Fairbanks, dancing as a boy wasn't the same. I couldn't do it, I couldn't take the same classes and be the same person. I had to become something different. So I did. No more art, no more dance, not until highschool at least!

I start bugging my mom for new clothes. I now want to start looking cool. I ask girl in the 5th grade, one by one to be my girlfriend. I liked them all. I wanted to be liked. I wanted to be loved. I wanted attention. I didn't have to do much as a 5th grader to get attention. 

The 5th grade turned out ok, however I kept hearing about a popular kid in Fairbanks by the name of Bobby Wilken. Girls would actually ask me "What are you going to do when Bobby comes back to this school?" I would laugh it off. 

Bobby does return to Denali elementary where I was popular. We immediately become enemies. We would star each other down, secretly engaged our middle fingers across the classroom, scowl, threaten. We became friends, then enemies again... where we remain.

Bobby is an important figure, him and his father. He was in my honest opinion a spoiled piece of shit that always got his way, even as friends I wasn't completely on board. He would prank call people, make fun of everything and everyone, he had someone whitewash me lol and I blamed the wrong person and had him thrown out of my birthday party, who was that... my best friend Jeremy... he was later given Top Secret access to resource that Governs what I currently have. It is space aged top secret in everyway. It is access to my thoughts, the ability to talk into being passing words off as my thoughts.. the ability to instigate movement. Ill go into detail, later on. The people in charge of it won't turn it off, they are too busy watching me be a normal human being passing me off as someone who is gross. I shower as a normal person, use the restroom, etc. They say there are others, there aren't. Only me. My group figured out how things work and did the best in uncovering Germany's and other's plans agains the US. Again, someting Ill go into later. 

I don't realize it but I am being profiled, even as a little kid. For instance. Why did Bobby's father return him to Denali where I was becoming popular? Why did I get moved to Alaska? Why did my father move us all the way from New Hampshire to Fairbanks?

By the way, I believe murder is involved. Murder of a father of an ex girlfriend... murder of an ex friend... so you might want to stay tuned. 

When I was a kid, I didn't know anything of Black people. I listened to Michael Jackson, but didn't really see color. It was just music. When I heard my first rap song I fell head over heals. My first rap albums Das Eff and Shaquille Oniel. Even though I had Das, something was missing. I wanted the real stuff. The real sh!t, Public Enemy, Digital Underground, etc.. My parents didn't know who was "real". And we didn't have cable until I was in highschool. 


When I experienced my first black influence it was euphoria. Philip Duty and Harold Colby fast break Philip down the court Philip throws a behind the back pass to Harold where he gracefully lays it up. Im introduced Tim Rodriguez who I realize is not like other white kids. He has an edge to him, he's part black in a way and is so without being over the top. He's not a wigger. He's tasteful, its natural... I hope to someday to be like Tim myself. Ill never forget the shoes he wore, I end up getting a pair myself. I was in awe! How in the World did Harold and Phillip do this. We were only 12 at the time. I am fortunate enough to say that I made friends with them, one a really good friend. I didn't realize, but this works against me in the future. 

Jr High moves through like a breeze. I enjoy Math, and P.E. (Physical Education), I also start to develop a lack of motivation for other classes and start to act out. 


I wake up one day with a bump in the back of my head, that of about the size of a Golf ball. 

My girfriend rubs the back of my head one day while driving back from her Grand parents house. She notices it I don't but it becomes the source of many problems and I cannot afford and am unsure that I can have it removed. When she does this, it's as if she is trying to tell me something, or that she knows something. When you see me, look for the large golf ball sized bump in the back of my head. There is a secret World within it. A secret World where people talk to cause insanity, talk to instigate thought, attempt to move body parts, watch everything I do through my eyes including the most intimate... and I cannot get them to leave. 


I just need to note, its important. As I write this I am completely owned by people that have infiltrated Google or are running Microsoft. Let me expain the scenario, there are people some where secret called a Time Vacuum, they are able to make my life a living hell and they are currently doing so. I believe it is the knob on the back of my head that is allowing these people to do this. They try to on occasion get me to attack people.


I scared all the white people out of power by trying to remove them. Soon all the owned the apparatus were African Americans. They want equality. 

I want my old house to be restored, is that ok? Someone may have created this future. That is how you have to think about it. 



I date a Hispanic, friends with African Americans
