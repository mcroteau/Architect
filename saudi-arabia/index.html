		<h1>Why the World secretly needs more Arabic linguists</h1>

		<img src="../images/africa-french.png"/>

		<p>There is a secret conflict between Latin derived nations and the middle east, can proof can be observed through language?</p>

		<blockquote>
		Hello<br/>
		Hallo<br/>
		Hola<br/>
		Ola<br/>
		Salut - French<br/>
		Hej<br/>
		<span style="display:inline-block;margin-top:6px"><img src="../images/russian-hello.png" style=""/></span><br/>
		</blockquote>

		<p>These are all Latin derived languages.</p>

		<p>What I mean by this is they all use some or all of the Latin alphabet.</p>

		<p>There is a secrect conflict between the middle east and the rest of the World.</p>

		<h2>Manufactured Conflicts</h2>

		<p>We don't think the Middle East looks at the rest of the World like most people do.</p>

		<p>Germany may have been given misinformation regarding genetics, eugenics and evolution from a scientist backed by an another nation... particularly Egypt at the time.</p>

		<p>So conflicts in the past may have been manufactured by the middle east.</p>

		<p>Germany had good relations with Egypt early 1900s</p>
		<p>Germany had good relations with Saudi Arabia 1920s</p>

		<p>Saudi Arabia is selling sex to African Americans as a reward</p>

		<p>Sex...</p>

		<p>I believe the French are giving their best...</p>
